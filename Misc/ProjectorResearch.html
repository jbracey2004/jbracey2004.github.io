         <h1>Home Projector Systems</h1>
         <p>The following video is of most elaberate of solutions. It covers most of the issues to consider. This is definently not the cheapest. I using this as a baseline to outline some of more important issues, like cost, implementation viability, and features.</p>

         <p>The next video goes over some more cost efficient options. Keep in mind all of the issues in the above video though.</p>

         <p>Some of the major concerns are how well the projector will look in a lit room, though that could be interesting since the living room does not have full windows. Another major concern is the distance the projector would have to be from the wall. In our space, 5ft would be cutting it close. Also the hookups could be interesting if we try to ceiling mount. Another question is what we wilk use for a screen.</p>

    <p>The features of these projectors so far are good, or at least competitive to TVs. In theory it could be a workable solution, but may take some work.</p>
